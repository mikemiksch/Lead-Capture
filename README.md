# WedCatch 1.4

This is a lead capture app designed for wedding professionals. This is a project undertaken to provide something for the benefit of the extensive wedding professional community I'm a part of, as well as to have a project that has well-defined roadmap of features to be implemented with each iterative build.

Leads are sorted by events, i.e. tradeshows, where multiple leads are potentially gathered in a relatively short amount of time. Each event provides a summary view of leads collected, and each lead can be viewed in greater detail individually.
